New Repository exploring GitHub via a Chromebook C11
I'm using this Repository on the Hisense Chromebook C11 and will be programming a Leonardo Arduboy if everything works out. I'm new to Arduino Programming, though I'm a licensed Apple iOS Developer and am comfortable programming in C++ and Unix via a Mac.
